Chapter 3: The Bargain

    The shop wasn’t there yesterday, yet its door swung open invitingly.

    Mara hesitated, but the scent of old books and incense pulled her in.

    The shopkeeper smiled, his teeth too white, his eyes too knowing.

    "You seek answers," he said, though she hadn’t spoken.

    He placed a pocket watch on the counter—its hands moving backward.

    "A trade," he murmured. "One memory for one truth."

    Mara thought of her brother’s disappearance, the gap in her mind.

    She nodded, and the shopkeeper’s grin widened. "Choose wisely."

    As his fingers brushed her temple, pain lanced through her skull.

    When she woke on the sidewalk, the shop was gone—but her hands were stained with ash.
