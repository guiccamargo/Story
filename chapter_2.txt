Chapter 2: The Silent Witness

    The old theater had been abandoned since the accident.

    Noah’s flashlight flickered as he stepped onto the rotting stage.

    Dust swirled in the beam, settling on the rows of empty seats.

    A child’s laughter echoed—impossible, he was alone.

    His boot hit something: a small, silver locket, still warm.

    The clasp opened to reveal a photo of a girl he recognized.

    She’d been in the news years ago—missing, presumed dead.

    A shadow moved in the balcony, too tall to be human.

    The laughter came again, closer now, morphing into a sob.

    The flashlight died, plunging him into darkness as something grabbed his wrist.
